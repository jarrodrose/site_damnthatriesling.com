  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Riesling Writings came about when a friend discussed a project of everyday philosophy. They invisaged their project being a series of questions
answered twice, first sober, and then whilst drinking.</p>

<p>The project changed course to basically become unrevised answers to important questions, but the name I had made up in my head stuck with me.</p>

<p>So now I am doing them myself in a somewhat ongoing capacity, despite that my friend’s project has now finished.</p>

<p>I am not a great writer or great thinker, but I am having fun with these.</p>

<p>Let this journey begin.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Question Rules</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Answer should be mostly stream of consiousness.</li>
  <li>Answer are only able to be edited for readability and grammar, not content or structure.</li>
  <li>Answers don’t have to respond to a question as such, but should have a theme at least.</li>
  <li>Sometimes I will write because I want to in a format that does not conform. :-)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Snippit Rules</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>There are no rules</li>
</ul>

<p><em>(I reserve the right to change the rules at any time because I can)</em></p>

<hr />

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>
I have included some past writings that were written in this style as it seems to fit.</p>
