    <p>Tonight I watch Iron Man 3 again. Nothing new about that. I love the Marvel movies. But despite having watched it several times before, it affected me differently this time. I realised somethings.</p>

<p><strong>I am Iron Man…</strong></p>

<p>No I am not crazy.
We are all Iron Man. Iron Man is a superhero. Powerful and strong at what he does. Almost.</p>

<p>Tony Stark is a great example of traits that live in us all. The potential for greatness. Not superhero greatness. Individual and personal greatness.</p>

<p>The biggest thing that holds up back from being the best us we can be is… <strong>us</strong>.</p>

<p>I am my own worst enemy. Same as everyone else on this planet. But like everyone else on this planet, I want to be more.</p>

<p>I want to dedicate my life to making the world a better place. For everyone, especially me.</p>

<p>I try to do everything. I try to pretend that nothing is wrong. Even when it is. And I inevitably fail. I want to stop failing.</p>

<p>So here starts the rebirth of me. I will probably fail at that also. But it will be the next start to my new life.</p>

<p>I’m going to start a list of achievements in my life. Sometimes it will be getting out of bed. Sometimes it will be rebuilding a broken thing. Hopefully it will sometimes be taking the bigger steps to becoming more.</p>

<p>I’m also going to start taking a list of things that I could have done better in the day. I’m going to follow my priorities as specified by urgency AND importance.</p>

<p>I’m going to apologise to all the people in my life that deserve it, all the people I have hurt by being me.
I’m going to tell all the people that I love that I love them.</p>

<p>I’m going to find the things I have lost. Friends, object, memories, my centre, my core, my kindness.</p>

<p>And I’m going to reintegrate them into myself, only adding those that power me. I will shed my innocence, my nievity, my poor judgement, my arrogance.</p>

<p>I’m going to save lives… first mine, and then others… From mediocrity.</p>

<p>I hope I live up to my dream. I won’t, but I have to keep trying.</p>

<p>Failing is how we learn to not fail again.</p>
