    <p>Space. The final frontier. These are the voyages of the star ship… Stop that! Serious answer, not a quotation from a TV series.</p>

<p>The word space isn’t even necessarily meaning planets, stars, moon, comets and the like. Space could just be meaning a gap, the void between objects. I feel like the term ‘outer space’ originated from the emptiness between things because from our point of view there is a huge amount of space between celestial bodies. Space could even just mean the emotional distance between individuals.</p>

<p>Space meaning the place where celestial bodies are located is there, unless you believe that the stars are pin pricks in a blanket or fireflies caught in a giant black web.Scientifically speaking, there is a lot more ‘out there’ than just earth or even just our solar system. We can observe and test for other planets, space dust, the radiation from stars, the emanations from the phenomena we call black holes. Unless it is all some sort of projection, simulation or matrix like situation, in which case maybe it’s not actually there. If we are part of the simulation, instead of it beginning just outside earth or just outside the solar system, then space is still there. I say this because we would also not be ‘there’ if simulated, but since, from our frame of reference, outer space would be there just as much as we are, we could justifiably content that it is ‘there’ as most things are relative and for our purposes, it would make no difference if simulated or not.</p>

<p>Space as a concept of distance or emptiness between things is hard to define if it is there. If someone were to say to you, ‘Make some space between those apples’, you would probably move the apples so that there was a gap, so that no apple was touching another. But is this space? Sure, the region no longer contains apple, but probably contains all manor of other things. Air particles, dust and the like. But from a nature speech point of view, there is space between the apples. But what does that mean? If this context it is just he absence of something. Can the absence of ‘stuff’ be there. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Space between people, I don’t think that exists. It is a defence mechanism. We think it keeps us safe, but all it does is separate us from others. Sometimes people feel it is necessary because it helps prevent painful memories, helps ignore tricky situations or not confront new situations. In reality, it is just ourselves trying to avoid dealing with the scary situation. It’s only in our minds and only in part of our minds. It only exists when we choose it to be there. It is the excuse, the explanation for a situation we don’t fully understand, the person we want to avoid. If you chose to avoid an individual/situation, that’s not space. That’s a choice. But having ‘space’ from something is a deflection, an avoidance. It can steal away the opportunity to evolve our mental pathways to become new versions of ourselves. Can it be useful short term, yes. But it is only a mental construct that is replaced when we actually deal with something. It is not ‘there’</p>

<p>Outer space - There.
The gap between things - ?
Space between people - Not there.</p>

<p>Is space there? Sometimes.</p>
