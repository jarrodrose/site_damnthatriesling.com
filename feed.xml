&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dreams are becoming almost more real than life itself; full of starlight and wicked exuberance. They feel old; ancient. A presence of kin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I cross the lake, I am inexplicably drawn to the Glittering Abyss. Th presence is there. A dual view of the world appears - the normal and the hyper real, full of glorious beauty, colourful delights, delectable wickedness and utter darkness. The presence speak to me without words - of belonging, of mutually beneficial objectives and of the true natural order of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My world erupts with sensation, a burst of energy and power like nothing I have experienced before. The feeling dissipates, leaving me with the feeling of new possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boat is on fire… THE BOAT IS ON FIRE!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A wave washes over the board, coming from nowhere and I know I caused it. The fire is out and the moment passes, leaving me to continue on my trudge across the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I return to my tribe following my experience on the lake. The Matriarch enquires after my distracted expression. We have a long discussion regarding my experience and to my dismay, the matriarch seems to become wary of me and my story. She tells tales of others, who in similar circumstances wandered into the Fractured Wylds. The tales get increasingly bizarre but there seems to be grains of truth in each of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I return to the Abyss several times over the next couple of weeks trying to repeat my experience. heightened states are achieved but nothing compared to that day. Feelings of home emanate from the Abyss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrive at the Abyss again just as the sun crosses down over the horizon. The Shining Abyss is really living up to its name today. I get a sudden rush, an adrenaline pulse just like the first time. As my excitement at the possibility of a second experience grows, I again get the double vision of the world. This time, however, the experience intensifies and continues until suddenly the hyper real is the only world I can perceive. This is the world that has been haunting my dreams. I lose all sense of the now. As I sit on the lake, I notice there are far too many stars and the bush around the lake seems more feral, more wild than usual. Despite how alien this place appears, it somehow feels very familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look down at the crystal formations and find the landmarks I can no longer find in the stars. I look to where ‘Last Light’ should have been, but there is nothing but wild dusty mirage heat in the distance behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feeling drawn to the depths of the Abyss, I dive down, away from the boat, passed the crystal structures and the location of the Gem mines which look untouched in this version of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep swimming down finding ever more beautiful crystals, reaching depths I had never dreamed of. Suddenly I feel the presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IT’S HERE! It’s here, feeling old beyond time, yet infinitely youthful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“WELCOME TO THE WYLD PLACE.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“WHAT IS IT YOU SEEK?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Meaning,” I reply, after a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“THAT IS A WEIGHTY QUESTIONS. WHAT YOU LEARN AND HOW YOU USE IT COULD BE A DANGER. i NEED A GUARANTEE.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A guarantee of what?” I ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“OF YOUR ALLEGIANCE. THAT MUCH POWER IS NOT JUST GIVEN TO ANYONE, YOUNG MOTE. I NEED REASSURANCE OF YOUR COMMITMENT TO OUR CAUSE. I WILL NEED TO CALL ON YOU, AND I NEED TO KNOW THAT YOU WILL ABIDE BY YOUR AGREEMENTS. WHAT I OFFER IS THE ABILITY TO AFFECT THE WORLD, TO NUDGE IT IN THE DIRECTION OF YOUR CHOOSING.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">Excerpt from a character diary.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Are We Monogamous?</title><link href="/riesling-writings/2016/10/18/are-we-monogamous.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Are We Monogamous?" /><published>2016-10-18T12:00:00+11:00</published><updated>2016-10-18T12:00:00+11:00</updated><id>/riesling-writings/2016/10/18/are-we-monogamous</id><content type="html" xml:base="/riesling-writings/2016/10/18/are-we-monogamous.html">&lt;p&gt;2016-10-18&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are We Monogamous?
No.
Well, it depends on your definition, some people might be.
But still no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me explain my position. I’m not saying people should be required to have more than one partner. Neither am I saying that if you don’t want to have multiple partner that something is wrong or you have failed. My contention is simply that we are not default monogamous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel monogamy is lying; cheating; hiding from true feelings. From ourselves and from others. What else in our lives are we required to only have one of. Only one pair of shoes? Only one t-shirt? Who wouldn’t say no to a second house or a car? What about only one friend…?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you only have one friend? Sure, you might have a best friend, but does that mean once you have found that best friend that you can never have another friend? That you have to disconnect from all your existing friends, otherwise you will be cheating on your best friend?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the difference between a friend and your ‘one true love’?
Whatever you said, “Why?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many levels of friendship from first meeting to best-est-friends-forever. Why is the border between friend and forbidden partner usually a physical one? Such an arbitrary division. (Don’t get me started on the completely unbalanced view society has in regards to promiscuity, with a section of the population being cheered on, while the other is shunned, shammed.) Is hugging acceptable between friends? Why? Is holding hands? Why? Massage? Snuggling on a couch? Kissing? Stroking? Groping? Fucking? Why not? Why did you draw the line where you did?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monogamy is about possession. “This is mine and you cannot have it”. “I don’t trust my partner to not leave so I bind them with words and shame for certain actions”. “It’s all about me. I have to be enough to fill their whole world forever.” You don’t owe other people. Even if you could, morally you should share with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monogamy is based on jealousy and a fear of loss. It is the lack of trust in your partner to be honest with you and to factor you into their lives. Lack of trust that they cannot engage with other without taking away from what you have or leaving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your partner cannot be stolen. You don’t own them. They are their own individual person at all times! If they chose to share their lives with you, you should be honoured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many relationships end with one person cheating on their partner. so many relationships are about control and power, not about love. Love is not about restraint or control. Love is about freedom, about caring, about life. It is life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said all that, being with only one person as your live partner is not wrong. It’s not even undesirable. I’m saying that monogamy is not default and is not the true state of humans. You can have only one life partner and still have a best friend that you tell all your secrets to. You are not monogamous! You have two life partners; you just happen to only have sex with one of them. Fucking is not the indication of good relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-monogamy is all about accepting that all the important people in your life hold a piece of your heart, in accepting the adventures of socialising and being free to explore your world of experiences. This has nothing to do with a life of no rules/anarchy. It does not have to be anarchy, you can have agreements between people. You already do. Agreements with yourself. Agreements with your partner/s. Agreements with the arbitrarily labels of friends or best friends&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friends are the essence of our non-monogamy. They show us that there are so many different type of friendships; of relationships. They show us that we can have multiple similar relationships, all co-existing peacefully as part of our social experience. How is this not the same of life partners, sexual or otherwise. If your partners are not also some of your closest friends, something is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans are not monogamous. Society tells us we are. But the truth of it is, life is all about the grey stuff. The in between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Re-examine your life. Be non-monogamous, even if it is only with your one life partner.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">2016-10-18</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Is Space There? (Sleep Deprived Edition)</title><link href="/riesling-writings/2016/07/21/is-space-there.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Is Space There? (Sleep Deprived Edition)" /><published>2016-07-21T11:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2016-07-21T11:00:00+10:00</updated><id>/riesling-writings/2016/07/21/is-space-there</id><content type="html" xml:base="/riesling-writings/2016/07/21/is-space-there.html">&lt;p&gt;Space. The final frontier. These are the voyages of the star ship… Stop that! Serious answer, not a quotation from a TV series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word space isn’t even necessarily meaning planets, stars, moon, comets and the like. Space could just be meaning a gap, the void between objects. I feel like the term ‘outer space’ originated from the emptiness between things because from our point of view there is a huge amount of space between celestial bodies. Space could even just mean the emotional distance between individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space meaning the place where celestial bodies are located is there, unless you believe that the stars are pin pricks in a blanket or fireflies caught in a giant black web.Scientifically speaking, there is a lot more ‘out there’ than just earth or even just our solar system. We can observe and test for other planets, space dust, the radiation from stars, the emanations from the phenomena we call black holes. Unless it is all some sort of projection, simulation or matrix like situation, in which case maybe it’s not actually there. If we are part of the simulation, instead of it beginning just outside earth or just outside the solar system, then space is still there. I say this because we would also not be ‘there’ if simulated, but since, from our frame of reference, outer space would be there just as much as we are, we could justifiably content that it is ‘there’ as most things are relative and for our purposes, it would make no difference if simulated or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space as a concept of distance or emptiness between things is hard to define if it is there. If someone were to say to you, ‘Make some space between those apples’, you would probably move the apples so that there was a gap, so that no apple was touching another. But is this space? Sure, the region no longer contains apple, but probably contains all manor of other things. Air particles, dust and the like. But from a nature speech point of view, there is space between the apples. But what does that mean? If this context it is just he absence of something. Can the absence of ‘stuff’ be there. I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space between people, I don’t think that exists. It is a defence mechanism. We think it keeps us safe, but all it does is separate us from others. Sometimes people feel it is necessary because it helps prevent painful memories, helps ignore tricky situations or not confront new situations. In reality, it is just ourselves trying to avoid dealing with the scary situation. It’s only in our minds and only in part of our minds. It only exists when we choose it to be there. It is the excuse, the explanation for a situation we don’t fully understand, the person we want to avoid. If you chose to avoid an individual/situation, that’s not space. That’s a choice. But having ‘space’ from something is a deflection, an avoidance. It can steal away the opportunity to evolve our mental pathways to become new versions of ourselves. Can it be useful short term, yes. But it is only a mental construct that is replaced when we actually deal with something. It is not ‘there’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outer space - There.
The gap between things - ?
Space between people - Not there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is space there? Sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

Nothing new about that. I love the Marvel movies. But despite having watched it several times before, it affected me differently this time. I realised somethings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am Iron Man…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No I am not crazy.
We are all Iron Man. Iron Man is a superhero. Powerful and strong at what he does. Almost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony Stark is a great example of traits that live in us all. The potential for greatness. Not superhero greatness. Individual and personal greatness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest thing that holds up back from being the best us we can be is… &lt;strong&gt;us&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am my own worst enemy. Same as everyone else on this planet. But like everyone else on this planet, I want to be more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to dedicate my life to making the world a better place. For everyone, especially me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to do everything. I try to pretend that nothing is wrong. Even when it is. And I inevitably fail. I want to stop failing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here starts the rebirth of me. I will probably fail at that also. But it will be the next start to my new life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to start a list of achievements in my life. Sometimes it will be getting out of bed. Sometimes it will be rebuilding a broken thing. Hopefully it will sometimes be taking the bigger steps to becoming more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also going to start taking a list of things that I could have done better in the day. I’m going to follow my priorities as specified by urgency AND importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to apologise to all the people in my life that deserve it, all the people I have hurt by being me.
I’m going to tell all the people that I love that I love them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to find the things I have lost. Friends, object, memories, my centre, my core, my kindness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’m going to reintegrate them into myself, only adding those that power me. I will shed my innocence, my nievity, my poor judgement, my arrogance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to save lives… first mine, and then others… From mediocrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope I live up to my dream. I won’t, but I have to keep trying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Failing is how we learn to not fail again.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">Tonight I watch Iron Man 3 again. Nothing new about that. I love the Marvel movies.
