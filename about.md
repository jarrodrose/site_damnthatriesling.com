Riesling Writings came about when a friend discussed a project of everyday philosophy. They invisaged their project being a series of questions answered twice, first sober, and then whilst drinking.

The project changed course to basically become unrevised answers to important questions, but the name I had made up in my head stuck with me.

So now I am doing them myself in a somewhat ongoing capacity, despite that my friend’s project has now finished.

I am not a great writer or great thinker, but I am having fun with these.

Let this journey begin.

**Question Rules**
- Answer should be mostly stream of consiousness.
- Answer are only able to be edited for readability and grammar, not content or structure.
- Answers don’t have to respond to a question as such, but should have a theme at least.
- Sometimes I will write because I want to in a format that does not conform. :-)


** Snippit Rules **
- There are no rules

(I reserve the right to change the rules at any time because I can)


** NOTE: ** 
I have included some past writings that were written in this style as it seems to fit.
