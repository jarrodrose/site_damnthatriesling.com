title: I am Iron Man!
---
Tonight I watch Iron Man 3 again. Nothing new about that. I love the Marvel movies. But despite having watched it several times before, it affected me differently this time. I realised somethings.

**I am Iron Man…**

No I am not crazy.
We are all Iron Man. Iron Man is a superhero. Powerful and strong at what he does. Almost.

Tony Stark is a great example of traits that live in us all. The potential for greatness. Not superhero greatness. Individual and personal greatness.

The biggest thing that holds up back from being the best us we can be is… **us**.

I am my own worst enemy. Same as everyone else on this planet. But like everyone else on this planet, I want to be more.

I want to dedicate my life to making the world a better place. For everyone, especially me.

I try to do everything. I try to pretend that nothing is wrong. Even when it is. And I inevitably fail. I want to stop failing.

So here starts the rebirth of me. I will probably fail at that also. But it will be the next start to my new life.

I’m going to start a list of achievements in my life. Sometimes it will be getting out of bed. Sometimes it will be rebuilding a broken thing. Hopefully it will sometimes be taking the bigger steps to becoming more.

I’m also going to start taking a list of things that I could have done better in the day. I’m going to follow my priorities as specified by urgency AND importance.

I’m going to apologise to all the people in my life that deserve it, all the people I have hurt by being me.
I’m going to tell all the people that I love that I love them.

I’m going to find the things I have lost. Friends, object, memories, my centre, my core, my kindness.

And I’m going to reintegrate them into myself, only adding those that power me. I will shed my innocence, my nievity, my poor judgement, my arrogance.

I’m going to save lives… first mine, and then others… From mediocrity.

I hope I live up to my dream. I won’t, but I have to keep trying.

Failing is how we learn to not fail again.
